            <p>Creating a personal portfolio website is more than just showcasing your workâ€”it's about expressing who you are as a professional and what values you bring to the table. In this article, I'll walk through my thought process and planning behind creating this modern portfolio website with classical influences.</p>
            
            <h2>Conceptual Foundation</h2>
            
            <p>When I started planning my portfolio website, I wanted it to reflect both my technical skills and my design sensibilities. The core concept I settled on was a balance between modern development techniques and classical design elements. This duality represents my approach to work: building cutting-edge solutions while respecting established principles and practices.</p>
            
            <p>I asked myself several key questions during the planning phase:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>How can I create a website that feels contemporary yet timeless?</li>
                <li>What design elements would best showcase my personality and work style?</li>
                <li>How can I incorporate the latest web technologies without sacrificing performance?</li>
                <li>What would make visitors remember my portfolio after they leave?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These questions guided my decision-making throughout the development process.</p>
            
            <h2>Inspiration Sources</h2>
            
            <p>I drew inspiration from several sources:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Architectural design</strong> - The interplay of solid structures and open spaces in classical architecture influenced my layout decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Contemporary digital portfolios</strong> - Studying how other developers showcase their work helped me understand effective presentation techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Pantone's Color of the Year 2025</strong> - The choice of Mocha Mousse as my primary color was inspired by its warm, inviting qualities and its position as a color trend</li>
                <li><strong>Classical typography juxtaposed with modern layouts</strong> - This contrast creates visual interest while maintaining readability</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Structural Planning</h2>
            
            <p>I mapped out the website structure before writing any code, focusing on creating a logical flow that would guide visitors through my professional story:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hero Section</strong> - An impactful first impression with my name, role, and a brief introduction</li>
                <li><strong>About Me</strong> - A deeper overview of my background, skills, and professional philosophy</li>
                <li><strong>Experience</strong> - A timeline-based representation of my professional journey</li>
                <li><strong>Skills</strong> - Visual representation of my technical abilities</li>
                <li><strong>Projects</strong> - Showcase of my work with filtering capabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Contact</strong> - Easy ways to get in touch with me</li>
                <li><strong>Blog</strong> - Articles sharing my knowledge and insights (you're reading it now!)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This structure was designed to create a narrative arc that potential clients or employers could follow, starting with the broad strokes of who I am and progressively diving deeper into my capabilities and work.</p>
            
            <h2>Technical Considerations</h2>
            
            <p>From a technical standpoint, I decided to prioritize the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance</strong> - Fast loading times and smooth interactions</li>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness</strong> - Flawless experience across all devices</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Ensuring the site is usable by everyone</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong> - Core functionality works without JavaScript, but enhanced experiences are available for modern browsers</li>
                <li><strong>Animation with purpose</strong> - Using animations to guide attention and enhance understanding, not just for decoration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This led me to select specific technologies for implementation:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML5/CSS3</strong> - For semantic markup and modern styling</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong> - For interactive elements</li>
                <li><strong>Three.js</strong> - For the interactive background that creates depth without overwhelming content</li>
                <li><strong>GSAP</strong> - For smooth, performant animations triggered by scrolling</li>
                <li><strong>ScrollReveal.js</strong> - For entrance animations that guide the user's journey</li>
                <li><strong>Typed.js</strong> - For the dynamic typing effect in the hero section</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Visual Design Decisions</h2>
            
            <p>The visual aspects of the site were carefully considered to create a cohesive experience:</p>
            
            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            
            <p>Choosing Pantone's Color of the Year 2025, Mocha Mousse (#a47864), as my primary color was a deliberate decision. This warm, earthy tone creates a sense of comfort and sophistication while being contemporary. I paired it with complementary neutrals to create a balanced palette that's easy on the eyes but still visually interesting.</p>
            
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            
            <p>I selected a pairing of DM Sans (for body text and UI elements) and Playfair Display (for headings and accents). DM Sans provides excellent readability with its modern geometric forms, while Playfair Display adds a classical elegance to important elements. This pairing embodies the modern-meets-classical theme that runs throughout the site.</p>
            
            <h3>Spacing and Layout</h3>
            
            <p>Generous white space was incorporated throughout the design to create breathing room for content and guide the visitor's eye to important elements. The layout follows a grid system that provides structure while allowing for creative variations that prevent monotony.</p>
            
            <h2>Immersive Elements</h2>
            
            <p>To create a memorable experience, I implemented several immersive elements:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Three.js particle background</strong> - A subtle, interactive backdrop that responds to scrolling</li>
                <li><strong>Custom cursor</strong> - A small detail that adds personality to the browsing experience</li>
                <li><strong>Scroll-triggered animations</strong> - Elements that reveal themselves as the user explores the page</li>
                <li><strong>Typing effect</strong> - Dynamic text that creates a sense of conversation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These elements were designed to be subtle enough not to distract from the content, but distinctive enough to create a unique, memorable experience.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>The planning phase was crucial to the success of this portfolio. By establishing a clear concept, structure, and technical approach before diving into development, I was able to create a cohesive experience that effectively communicates my professional identity.</p>
            
            <p>In the following articles in this series, I'll dive deeper into specific aspects of the implementation, starting with the color and typography decisions in the next piece.</p>
